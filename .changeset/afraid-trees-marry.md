'@sl-design-system/menu': patch
---

Fixed several accessibility issues; 
 - Improved VoiceOver in support Chrome
 - Fixed keyboard navigation in submenu

 - Applied new tokens to menu and menu item
 - Renamed the `part` identifying `sl-menu` from `listbox` to `menu`
 - removed `--sl-menu-min-inline-size` and `--sl-menu-max-inline-size`; you can style the size of the menu through the `menu` part.
