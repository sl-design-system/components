'@sl-design-system/tag': minor
---

Various improvements:
- Add missing `disabled` property to `<sl-tag-list>` so the stack tag can be disabled
- Change design from a visual stack to a regular tag with a `<number>+` text
- Use the same size (`24px` for `md`, `36px` for `lg`) that is used elsewhere in the design system
- Do not show the remove button when the tag is disabled
- Use the new contextual tokens
