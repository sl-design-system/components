'@sl-design-system/virtual-list': patch
---

This is a new package that provides a virtual scrolling solution for rendering large lists efficiently. It includes a web component `<sl-virtual-list>` and a `VirtualizerController` for integration with LitElement.

It is based on `@tanstack/virtual-core` and offers customizable item rendering, configurable item sizing, and gap settings.
