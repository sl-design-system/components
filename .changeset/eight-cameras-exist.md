Combobox improvements:
- Show hover style on combobox, similar to text-field
- Remove create-custom-option when you select an option
- Use built-in plus icon instead of importing it
- Fix styling of `<sl-combobox-create-custom-option>`
- Add hidden placeholder for the selected items when in multiple mode
- Start keyboard navigation on the selected item when in single mode
- Hide popover when the focus leaves the combobox
- Reset the text to the selected option when focus leaves the combobox
- Show the popover immediately and only fade-out when hiding it
