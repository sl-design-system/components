Improve horizontal scrolling experience:
- Add shadows to the left and right of the grid when it is scrollable
- Add the new `<sl-scrollbar>` when the grid is horizontally scrollable
- Make sure the scrollbar is always visible (sticky at the bottom of the grid)
- Position the scrollbar relative to the sticky columns
- Add ability to use sticky columns at the end of the grid
