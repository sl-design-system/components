Overhaul of how (custom) icons are maintained in figma and exported to be used in the packages. 

The following icons have changed:
- `circle` has been renamed to `circle-solid`

The following icons have been added:
- `badge-available`
- `badge-away`
- `badge-donotdisturb`
- `badge-offline`
- `error`
- `info`

The following items have been removed (mainly in cleaning up, they were never meant to be there)
- `svg-sort`
- `svg-sort-down`
- `svg-sort-up`
