A new `MessageDialogService` for Angular applications that simplifies opening and managing message dialogs programmatically.
The service provides methods to display confirmation, alert, and custom message dialogs with proper lifecycle management and Angular integration.
Dialogs can be created with simple text messages or by passing custom Angular components for more complex scenarios.
