'@sl-design-system/badge': patch
---

Various improvements:
- Add new `emphasis` property with `subtle` (default) and `bold` values
- Reduce sizes to `sm`, `md` (default) and `lg`, with `sm` only meant to be used in combination with the avatar component
- Add padding around the icon
- Make the badge round based on the content (icon only, or only 1 character)
