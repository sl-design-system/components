Various improvements:

- Keyboard entry is now supported. Users can type in a date, but they can also use the arrow keys to navigate between date parts and increment/decrement values. This works for any locale
- Require confirmation is a new prop that, when enabled, requires users to confirm their selection in the calendar popover before it is applied to the input field. This prevents accidental date changes and allows users to review their selection before confirming it
- Styling improvements
