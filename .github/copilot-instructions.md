We use GitHub for hosting our code and managing issues.

When using the GitHub MCP server, always limit the requests to the "sl-design-system" organization on GitHub. If not specified explicitly, use the "components" repository.

When creating a branch for a new feature or bug fix, use the following naming convention:
- For new features: `feature/<issue-number>-<description>`
- For bug fixes: `fix/<issue-number>-<description>`
