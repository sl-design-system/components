# Welcome to the Sanoma Learning Design System

Welcome to the Sanoma Learning Design System. This is a collection of components, styles and guidelines to help you create consistent and user-friendly interfaces for Sanoma Learning products.

In the sidebar you will find a list of components that are available in the design system. You can click on a component to see more information about it and to see examples of how it can be used.

If you are looking for documentation, you can go to [sanomalearning.design](https://sanomalearning.design).

The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sl-design-system/components).

Each component has a status that indicates the maturity of the component. The statuses are:
- <Draft>Draft</Draft> The component is in active development and not ready for use.
- <Preview>Preview</Preview> The component is ready for use and available in all themes, but not yet used by CFAs.
- <Stable>Stable</Stable> The component is mature and used by CFAs.
- <Deprecated>Deprecated</Deprecated> The component will be removed in the future and should be avoided.
