# Wrappers

Wrappers are Angular components that encapsulate and extend the functionality of base design system components. They provide a more Angular-friendly API and integrate seamlessly with Angular applications.

For all Angular Wrappers we provide we have made a basic example to show you the usage of the wrapper component. In some cases there is a bit more extensive example.


The in and outputs on a wrapper component are the same as on the native webcomponent, so for finding out which options a specific component has have a look on the [documentation website](https://sanomalearning.design) and find the 'code' page for that component.
