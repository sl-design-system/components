The basics of plugin development can be found here:
  https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/plugin-quickstart-guide/

When developing the plugin can be loaded in Figma by selecting (from the menu bar) `Plugins` > `Development` > `Import plugin from manifest`.
When you run `yarn watch` in this folder the plugin will be hot reloaded on changes.

You can also open the web inspector to have a console and inspector: `Plugins` > `Development` > `Show/ Hide console`.

To publish the new version of the plugin open the `Actions` popover, from the bottom toolbar, and go to the `Plugins & widgets` tab and select `Publish new version` from the more button (`...`) behind the `SLDS Theme Selector` with the development label.
