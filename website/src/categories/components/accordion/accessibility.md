## Alignment

The icons are left-aligned to improve the experience for users with low vision, as the expanded/collapsed indicator is closer to the accordion title.

## Keyboard interactions

Each accordion is a tab stop. `Space` or `Enter` keys expand or collapse accordions, which are collapsed by default. Interactive elements within expanded accordions integrate into the tab order automatically.
