## When to use

### Chunking information and reducing clutter
Reduce cognitive load for users by simplifying the interface. When you have a large amount of content, consider using accordions to hide non-essential information initially. Place detailed content within the accordion pane. Users can click on the accordion title to reveal the hidden information.

## When not to use

### When most items need to be opened
If users need to open the majority of accordion items, it’s better to reveal all the content instead of hiding some.
Accordion components are designed to manage content visibility efficiently. If most items need to be expanded, consider alternative designs that display content upfront.
