## When to use

### User profiles
Avatars are commonly used to display user profile pictures. Avatars provide a face to a name. When users see their own profile picture, it fosters a sense of ownership and personal connection.

### People representation
In the context of contact lists, avatars serve as visual cues that swiftly connect users to their contacts. By associating a face or image with each entry, avatars make the list more relatable and memorable. Whether it’s a colleague, student, or teacher, avatars provide that instant recognition, making interactions more personal and efficient.

## When not to use

### Intrusive Design
Don’t let avatars distract from essential content. Ensure they enhance, rather than hinder, usability.
