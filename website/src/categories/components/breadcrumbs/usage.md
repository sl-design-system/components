## When to use

### Hierarchy representation
Breadcrumbs visually depict the structural hierarchy of a digital product. They guide users through layers of content, showing where they are within the system. Each breadcrumb link corresponds to a specific level in the hierarchy. They typically appear horizontally at the top of a digital product.

## When not to use

### Limited content depth
When your digital product has shallow navigation, breadcrumbs may add clutter without significant benefit. If there are only one or two layers of hierarchy, users can find their way without breadcrumbs.

### User navigation path
The actual path a user takes during their session may differ from the breadcrumb trail and is not shown within the breadcrumb.
Users might jump directly from one section to another, use search functionality, or follow external links. Their journey can be nonlinear and influenced by various factors.

## Options

With these options, you can tweak the appearance of the breadcrumbs in Figma. They are available in the Design Panel so you can compose the breadcrumbs to exactly fit the user experience need for the use case you are working on.
