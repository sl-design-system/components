## When to use

The Buttonbar component is typically used in user interfaces where a group of actions can be performed related to a specific context or where the user needs to make a choice between a few options. It's designed to provide a clean and organized way to present up to three buttons side by side, which can be useful in various scenarios such as form submissions, navigation, or initiating different functionalities.

Here are a few examples:
- **Form Actions**: When you have a form that requires actions like 'Submit', 'Cancel', or 'Reset', a Buttonbar can neatly group these actions together.
- **Navigation**: In cases where you need to guide the user through a multi-step process, like a wizard or a survey, Buttonbars can be used to navigate between steps with 'Next', 'Previous', or 'Finish' buttons.
- **Functional Grouping**: If there are multiple actions that can be taken on a particular piece of content or a section within a page, such as 'Edit', 'Delete', or 'Save', the button bar will group these actions in a logical and visually cohesive manner.
