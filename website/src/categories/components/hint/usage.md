## UX Writing

A hint offers context and guidance to a form control. Follow these tips to craft informative and user-friendly hints:

### Conciseness
Keep the help text brief, using only 1-2 short, complete sentences. Avoid unnecessary verbosity to maintain clarity.

### Descriptive Clarity
While being concise, ensure the hint provides clear and informative guidance. Explain what happens when the user selects the option, ensuring they understand the consequences or benefits associated with their choice.

### User-Centered Language 
Use language that aligns with your target audience. Avoid technical jargon or industry-specific terms that might confuse users.

### No Repetition 
Avoid merely restating the label in different phrasing within your hint. Instead, focus on providing additional context and information that enhances the user's understanding.

### Consistency
Maintain a consistent style and tone throughout the hint. This consistency aids users in understanding and interacting with your interface.
