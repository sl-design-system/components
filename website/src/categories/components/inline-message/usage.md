## When to use

### Contextual messages
Use an inline message to provide additional context or supporting information to a particular UI element or function.

### Real-time feedback
Use an inline message to provide real-time feedback with information about what's going to happen or has happened.

## When not to use

### Critical information
Avoid using inline messages for critical system-level messages such as errors (e.g. loss of functionality). For critical messages, a component that partially or fully interrupts the user experience is more appropriate. Inline messages are not suitable for conveying critical system-level messages, such as errors or significant loss of functionality. 
Critical alerts require immediate attention and should not be buried within the regular flow of content. Users need a more prominent and disruptive notification to address critical issues. For critical messages, consider using components that partially or fully interrupt the user experience, such as a [dialog](/categories/components/dialog/) or banner. These ensure that users cannot miss important information.

### Single input
Avoid using inline messages to add context to a single input field (e.g., a text field). Inline messages are meant to provide additional context or supporting information related to UI elements. However, for a single input, they can clutter the interface and distract users from their primary task.
Instead of inline messages, use [hints](/categories/components/form-field/) to guide users. Hints are less intrusive and provide concise instructions without overwhelming the user.

## Variants

Inline messages come in various flavors, each suited for specific situations:
Info: For general informative messages.
Success: To indicate successful completion of an action.
Danger: To highlight critical errors or issues.
Warning: For potential problems that need attention.
