**Notes:**
1. The `aria-disabled` should not be used as a one-for-one replacement for the `disabled` attribute because they have different functionalities:

- `disabled` dims the menu button/menu item visually, takes it out of the tab-focus sequence, prevents actions (click, enter) on it and announces it as 'dimmed' or 'disabled' in a screen reader.

- `aria-disabled` only does the latter. You will need to disable the functionality yourself. This might be useful for scenarios where you don't want to take the menu button / menu item out of the navigation flow.

When `disabled` is added there is no need to also add `aria-disabled`. Everything `aria-disabled` does, `disabled` does as well. You can read more on the difference and in which scenarios which option might be preferable on the [MDN page about aria-disabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-disabled).
