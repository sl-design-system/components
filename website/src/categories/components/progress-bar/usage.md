## When to use

### Long operations
A progress bar is essential for tasks that can take a considerable amount of time to complete or have unpredictable durations. It helps users stay informed about the ongoing status of the process.

### File uploads/downloads
A progress bar is used to visually indicate the progression of system operations like downloading and uploading files. It provides users with real-time feedback on the status of these processes.

### Quantitative information
A progress bar is suitable when the progress of a task can be quantitatively measured, such as using percentages. For instance, it's effective for showing teachers the percentage completion of their students' assignments.

## When not to use

### Expanded information
When the loading time is anticipated to display extensive information, opt for [skeleton](categories/components/spinner/) states instead of a progress bar.

### Short actions
If a process completes quickly, typically in less than 5 seconds, it's better to use a [spinner](categories/components/spinner/) instead of implementing a progress bar.
