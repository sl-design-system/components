## When to use

### Loading states
Use skeletons to represent content while data is being fetched. For instance, display a skeleton list before actual items load.

### Page transitions
During page transitions or navigation, show skeletons to indicate that content is loading. This maintains user engagement.

### Image loading
When images take time to load, display image placeholders using skeletons. Users perceive faster loading times.

## When not to use

### Misleading expectations
Don’t use skeletons if they might mislead users. For instance, showing a skeleton for a feature that won’t load can frustrate users.
