## Key Points

Here are key considerations to make the spinner usable for all users, including those with disabilities.

  - When updating only a portion of a page, place the spinner in that specific part of the page.

  - If you aren't clear about where to place the spinner, set it where you want the user's attention to be after complete loading.

  - The spinner is unaffected by reduced motion. Disabling it can confuse the user as it might seem like the process has stopped.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties for an spinner provide essential information to assistive technologies and screen readers. They convey the spinner's role and additional properties to ensure accessibility and a better user experience for individuals using assistive technology.
