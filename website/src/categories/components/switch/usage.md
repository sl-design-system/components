## When to use
A switch component is best used when:

- **Binary Settings**
When you have straightforward on/off options that users should be able to control effortlessly, switches are the ideal choice. They offer a simple and intuitive way to switch between two states.

- **Instant Feedback**
Ensure users receive immediate, clear visual feedback regarding the status of a setting. Changes are instantly visible when a switch is toggled.

## When not to use

- **Complex Settings**
If your setting has multiple states or requires more than a simple on/off toggle, switches may not be suitable. Consider alternative components like checkboxes, dropdown menus, or sliders that can accommodate more options and nuances in such cases.
