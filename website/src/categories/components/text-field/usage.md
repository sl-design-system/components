## When to use

Text fields come in handy in certain situations:

### Unique input 
When users need to input information that is unique and cannot be anticipated from a predefined set of options. Text fields provide the flexibility to capture diverse and unpredictable data.

  ### Memorable data
  In cases where users need to input memorable data quickly, a free-form input method is more efficient than a complex control interface. Text fields offer a straightforward way for users to provide the information they have in mind.

## When not to use
Text fields may not be the best choice in the following scenarios:

  ### Predefined options
  When input data can be conveniently selected from predefined options using checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, or text areas. These structured input controls enhance efficiency and minimize errors in such cases.

  ### Sensitive information
  For handling sensitive or confidential information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, it's advisable to utilize specialized secure input fields designed to obscure the entered data for enhanced security.

  ### Longer text responses
  Consider using text areas when you anticipate the input length will exceed the width of a text field or when you encourage users to provide longer text responses.
