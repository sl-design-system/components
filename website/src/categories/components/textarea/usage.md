## When to use

The following guidance describes when to use the Text Area component.

### Unconstrained input
When you need to collect input that can be of variable length, such as comments, descriptions, or notes.
Use a text area when the newline character (line break) is a valid part of the content.

## When not to use

The following guidance describes when not to use the Text Area component.

### Single-line input
If the input is expected to be short and concise, consider using a the Text Field component instead of a Text Area.
For instance, when collecting a username or password a single-line input is more appropriate.
