title: Time field
description: The Time Field allows users to enter a time (HH:MM) by typing or using a dropdown with split hour and minute columns. It supports configurable hour/minute steps with free typing by default, plus an optional strict mode that enforces steps that require matching a stepped option. The control favours predictability (no reordering or injected suggestions), solid keyboard flow, and clear validation.
