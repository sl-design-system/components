## When to use


### Familiar Actions
Use icon-only toggle buttons for actions that are easily recognizable by users through common icons. For example, play/pause, like/unlike, or expand/collapse are actions where users can quickly understand the meaning just by looking at the icon.

### Toolbars and Media Controls:
Icon-only toggle buttons are commonly used in toolbars and media controls where space is at a premium and users need quick access to certain functionalities, like muting audio or changing playback states.

### UI Element Toggles
They are useful for toggling UI elements on or off, such as expanding or collapsing a drawer, showing or hiding a menu, or turning a feature on or off within the application interface.

## When not to use

### Toggling Features or Settings
In forms or settings panels, it's important to meet user expectations for consistency and clarity. Users typically expect to see switches when enabling or disabling features. If you use an icon-only button instead, it can confuse users and disrupt the uniformity of the interface. So, in these situations, always opt for a switch component. It provides a clear, intuitive way for users to understand the state of a feature.
