## When to use

### Familiar Actions and UI Element Toggles
Icon-only toggle buttons are ideal for actions that are easily recognizable by users through common icons, such as play/pause, like/unlike, or expand/collapse. These buttons are commonly used in toolbars and media controls where space is limited and quick access to functionalities like muting audio or changing playback states is necessary. They are also useful for toggling UI elements on or off, such as expanding or collapsing a drawer, showing or hiding a menu, or turning a feature on or off within the application interface.

## When not to use

### Toggling Features or Settings
In forms or settings panels, it's important to meet user expectations for consistency and clarity. Users typically expect to see switches when enabling or disabling features. If you use an icon-only button instead, it can confuse users and disrupt the uniformity of the interface. So, in these situations, always opt for a [switch](/categories/components/switch/) component. It provides a clear, intuitive way for users to understand the state of a feature.
