## Understanding Component Structure

Sanoma Learning Design System components are organized for clarity and ease of use. Familiarize yourself with the component structure:

1. Hierarchical Structure: Components are organized hierarchically, with main components having variants or states nested within them. Explore these nested components to find the perfect fit for your design.
1. Customization: Components often have customizable properties that you can adjust in the right-hand 'Properties' panel. Experiment with these to tailor components to your design needs.
