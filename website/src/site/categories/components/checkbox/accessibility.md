Having an accessible application is not only achieved by writing good code, but also (maybe even MORE so) by writing good copy. To make sure checkbox groups and their options are clear for all users make sure to keep these points in mind:

### Group labels


Positioned above checkbox groups to ensure clear organization when multiple checkboxes share a common category. They must effectively convey the common theme while maintaining a balance between brevity and descriptiveness for user clarity.


By following the tips below, you can write group labels that effectively categorize checkboxes.

- **Conciseness**: Keep the label concise. Use as few words as possible while still conveying the primary purpose or theme of the checkboxes in the group.

- **Descriptive Clarity**: While being concise, ensure the label provides enough information to make it clear what the checkboxes within the group represent. Use descriptive language that leaves no ambiguity.

- **User-Centered Language**: Use language that your target audience can easily understand. Avoid complex terminology or jargon that might confuse users.

- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent style and wording for group labels throughout your interface. This creates a cohesive design and makes it easier for users to understand the organization.
